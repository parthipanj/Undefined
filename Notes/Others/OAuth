OAuth
*****

- OAuth (Open Authorization) is an open standard for token-based authentication and authorization on the Internet

- OAuth 2.0 provides users with the ability to grant third-party access to web resources without sharing a password

- Authentication is the process of verifying who you are. When you log on to a PC with a user name and password you are authenticating.

- Authorization is the process of verifying that you have access to something. Gaining access to a resource (e.g. directory on a hard disk) because the permissions configured on it allow you access is authorization.
